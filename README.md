# bungie-api-rgbs
Drive peripheral RGBs with Bungie API data

## Current status
- only suppports Corsair iCUE so far (because that's what I have)
- none of the Bungie API work is done yet
- runs as a Node CLI app currently, will likely turn it into an Electron app eventually

### Running the code in its current state
- Run `npm install`
- Place an image in the `images/` directory
- Set the image filename in `index.ts`
- Fiddle with the animation config if you'd like
- Run `npm start` to start
